# insta_app
Here we are implementing and harnassing MongoDB, Express, React, & Node.js to build a Full Stack "MERN" application from start to finish. The insta_app is a simple social media MERN application that allows users to capture special memories and post the events that happened in their lives. I also applied material-UI to create a simple, seemless U.I. (user interface), and moment from the React library to validate the date & time the item was posted.
